Considering the screen view as looking out to the front of the spacecraft

SPACEBAR  : Stop all craft movements ( translations and rotations )

E  : Forward craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

C  : Reverse craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

S  : Leftwards craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

F  : Rightwards craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

R  : Upwards craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

V  : Downwards craft thrust ( translation of centre of mass )

D  : Stop all craft translations

. OR NumPad2  : Upwards pitch of craft ( rotation about centre of mass )

O OR NumPad8  : Downwards pitch of craft ( rotation about centre of mass )

, OR NumPad1  : Leftwards yaw of craft  ( rotation about centre of mass )

/ OR NumPad3  : Rightwards yaw of craft  ( rotation about centre of mass )

K OR NumPad4  : Leftwards roll of craft  ( rotation about centre of mass )

; OR NumPad6  : Rightwards roll of craft  ( rotation about centre of mass )

L  : Stop all craft rotations

G  : go home to initial craft position

NB Current controller model is 'inertial', that is : it will happen in a
   certain way until you stop it. If in doubt hit SPACEBAR and get your
   bearings. You will bounce off the Earth/Sun if too close and get punted
   back if you go too far way.
