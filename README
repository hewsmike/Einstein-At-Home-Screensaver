Repository for development of screensaver code using a rather updated version of the Einstein At Home project's build system as outlined here :

04/12/2013 : Revamp of framework to re-incorporate SDL ( version 2 )
    - retire Shader_OBJ, Events and TriggerTimer classes
    - GLFW no longer used
    - on mac's only OS X supported
    - GLEW retained to manage dynamic function pointers on win32
    - WIN_OGL_WORKAROUND ( source level switch ) removed
    - NB zlib_licence.txt as applying to SDL 2 usage
    - use OpenGL ES 2.x ie. that subset of OpenGL forwards compatible contexts.
    - use sdl_ttf library for rendering, using font interface via FreeType.
    - expand build system ( initially by stubs ) for Android and iOS.

07/04/2014
    - Note to developers, set the BUILD_HOST variable in topbuild.sh ( around
      line # 600 ) for proper operation of the build scripts.
