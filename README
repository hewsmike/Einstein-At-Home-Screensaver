04/12/2013 : Revamp of framework to re-incorporate SDL ( version 2 )
    - retire Shader_OBJ, Events and TriggerTimer classes
    - GLFW no longer used
    - on mac's only OS X supported
    - GLEW retained to manage dynamic function pointers on win32
    - WIN_OGL_WORKAROUND ( source level switch ) removed
    - NB zlib_licence.txt as applying to SDL 2 usage
    - assume that OpenGL forwards compatible contexts are available at runtime
      and thus display list functionality nolonger usable.
    - use sdl_ttf library for rendering, using font interface via FreeType.
    - expand build system ( initially by stubs ) for Android and iOS.
