Viewpoint sampling mod to Starsphere application

NB : I have taken the liberty of stopping the time based evolution of the Starsphere, so
that one can position the view to suit without having to continually fiddle using the
mouse to keep the view constant. Let me know if that was a bad idea.

usage : press F1 when you want a sample taken of the screen view

An SVG file is emitted into the graphics application's working directory, overwriting
any prior identically named files , with incrementing of filenames per session :

E@H_starsphere_sample_0.svg
E@H_starsphere_sample_1.svg
E@H_starsphere_sample_2.svg

.... etc

containing ( in XML comment labelled sections ) suitably transformed co-ordinates of the
stars, pulsars and supernovae ( colors designated using the SVG color names of "white",
"purple" and "sienna" respectively ) with each as a filled unit circle like so :

<circle cx="575.256" cy="271.912" r="1" stroke="white" fill="white"/>

Aspect ratio is preserved ie. the sphericity of the Starsphere. Coordinates have been
shifted and scaled to resemble the view, with the exception of the sense of the
horizontal and vertical coordinates ie. in which directions do they increase/decrease -
as that in turn will depend on your SVG viewer/editor ( so I left that alone ). That is,
you may have to flip in the horizontal and/or vertical axis ....

The key named program variables for reproduction of a given view/transform are :

   xvp
   yvp
   zvp

and the expression

   Zrot - rotation_offset

I have indicated the points of control in the code for important aspects using a comment
line beginning thus :

   // TODO/CONTROL :

Enjoy ! :-)
